For space reasons, we don't keep our code here. It's still on our website. So you're probably wondering why we put a folder here anyway  The answer? It's for you. One requirement of our licence is that you make the soure code avalible to those you distribute it to. We make ours avalible on our website. You, on the other hand, might not have a website or somewhere to put your code while you're working with it or distributing it. So I provided this nifty folder! Happy coding!
