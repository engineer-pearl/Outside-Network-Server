Thank you for downloading my Outside Social Networking Client. Your support means a lot to me.
I created this to fill a number of needs. As you may or may not know, I was once a Tumblr user. There were many things that we as a community feared and disliked about the social media network. I wanted to make something that had many of the good qualities, without so many of the bad.
Seeing as you are digging into my files, I would like to make a few requests:
1. Please don't remove names from the CREDITS file.
2. Please add your name to the CREDITS file when you make a change, even if it's small.
3. Please don't use this to be mean to people. I mean honestly, everyone is a little evil, but mean is just too far. :(
4. If you find you don't like the licence I chose, please feel free to find a copyleft you like better, and then message me. [you might also want to look on the site. I'm including a clause where if i put up a licence on the site, it can superseed the one in the program itself, just in case. :P
5. Make it yours. This social media client is YOUR client. YOU dictate what it does, what it can do, what it can't. Own it. After all, YOU are the the one in control, not me. I made that choice in the beginning :P

One more thing: it's okay to make and give coppies to everyone and anyone. Same thing goes for the server. I'd rather you didn't give corrupted or infected coppies, but that's between you and your clients :P .
