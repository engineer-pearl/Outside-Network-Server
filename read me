This is the Outside Social Network Server. Some major changes are comming up. Here's the current todo list:

- Determine structure of posts (I need to figure out what the best storage method is instead of just doing it)
- Get networking going
- Support Pearl and Javascript mods if possible
- Get disqus avalible on wiki to make myself more accessable

I am also on tumblr: engineer-pearl0
