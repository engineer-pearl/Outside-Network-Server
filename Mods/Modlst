/*DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE MANUALLY I STG
* LET ME HANDLE THAT OKAY?!?!
* okay fine you can edit it
* but be aware
* I built the thing to handle it for you.
* And if it's not working properly, then I NEED TO KNOW
* so that I can fix it and not be spreading a problematic version
* Okay?
* Also, please make the mods self-contained and not dependant on the filename.
* if you need it to be filename dependant then please put your filename in a file which can be edited and call it from that instead of just using it in your code.
* Why, you ask?
* So that if something changes about the file naming system or if two mods have conflicting filenames, the user can fix it easily
* Thank you!
